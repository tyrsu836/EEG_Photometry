This zip file contains 3 scripts and some example data that I used to create the scripts, test it on these files before testing it on your own.
It also contains a folder of scripts from @gramm that I used for the plotting

Files needed:
	For Pre_Processing:
	'...EEG TEXT.txt' - Data output from the EEG rig
	'...DATA.mat' - Signal data output from the Fiber-Photometry rig
	'...TIME.mat' - Time data output from the Fiber-Photometry rig
	'plot_heatmap.m' - personalized heatmap plotting script
	'@gramm' - folder containing gramm figure plotting scripts
	
	For Post_Processing:
	'...EEG SCORED.txt' - Scored EEG output from the EEG_Processing program
	'...EEGPh.mat' - Our MATLAB output from the 'Pre_Processing' script

Steps involved:

1. Move your '...EEG TEXT.txt' data file and your Fiber photometry files ('...DATA.mat' and '...TIME.mat') into the 'EEG and FPh Processing' Folder.
2. Run Pre_Processing
	Now You will have your '...EEGPh.mat' located in the 'EEG and FPh Processing' Folder.

3. Use the EEGProcessing script to score sleep-wake states (not included in this file - ask Shibin/Jeremy for it)
	This should give you a .txt output that you should call '...EEG SCORED.txt'

4. Make sure your '...EEG SCORED.txt' and '...EEGPh.mat' are in the 'EEG and FPh Processing' Folder.
5. Run Post_Processing
	Now you will have a new .csv file called '...EEG SCORED.csv' which has all of your transition times in it in the 'EEG and FPh Processing' Folder.
	You will also have a new folder with .csv files in it for each transition type which hold Fiber Photometry data for 10 seconds before and after each transition.
	This script also plots several figures for you.
